# ðŸ˜‡ Chlallenges 

The Most Two Exsiting challenges that i faced during building this projects are:

1. Upload multiple pictures to firestore and get all the URLS of uploaded image.For one image it was easy but for multiple image it was not working as i am expected.
So took the help of Frank van Puffelen(Google cloud Employee) and solved the problem accordingly. [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71702368/why-promise-all-in-below-code-returning-an-empty-array) is the link to my stackoverflow post.
