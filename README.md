# Introduction

**chobi**-A photo sharing app bootstrapped with **_<span style={color:red}>React </span>_** and **_Firebase_**.

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

The salient purpose of this project is learning. While building this app i tried to have a firm grasp on below topics:

1. React, React-Hooks, Custom Hooks, Context API. <br />
2. React Router DOM v6. <br />
3. Firebase. <br />

Besides I have a plan to use this app to share photos of my family members by extending some of its feature.

# ðŸ˜‡ Challenges:

The most two exciting challenges that i faced during building this project are:

## First:

Upload multiple pictures to firestore and get all the URLS of uploaded image.For one image it was easy but for multiple image it was not working as expected.
So I took help from Frank van Puffelen(Google cloud Employee) and solved the problem accordingly. [**here**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71702368/why-promise-all-in-below-code-returning-an-empty-array) is the link to my stackoverflow post.

## Second:

The second most exciting challenges that i faced, is while working on editing a post with multiple pictures. Because for a post with single image is easy enough to edit. But for multiple page i had to pull all the images from database populate them on the same modal that i used to for a new post and if user remove a picture from the list i had delete it before updating the post. However, though it took me some times to get around this but i solved that by myself.
